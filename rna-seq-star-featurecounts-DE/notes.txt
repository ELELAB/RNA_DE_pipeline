cutadapt piping was not working - that's why I have created links to orig files
get_cut_adapt function was not working - cutadapt_pe input section is re-defined (get_cut_adapt functions needs to be corrected to be working correctly

- probably just  "pipe/cutadapt/{S}/{U}.{{read}}.fastq{E}" into up-to date destination/format
- this function should be giving input either to SE or PE cutadapt modes
