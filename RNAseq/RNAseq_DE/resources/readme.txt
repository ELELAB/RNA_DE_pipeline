Required resources:
1) genome.fasta
2) genome.gtf
For RNA seq, primary assembly should be used (without alt contigs, HLA, etc.)

note: Resources were downloaded using 01_download_resources.sh

genome_noAlt.gtf is generated in order to run featureCounts producing results compatible with STAR counts output (primary for the purpose of comparing the results in order to evaluate pipelines' similarity).
